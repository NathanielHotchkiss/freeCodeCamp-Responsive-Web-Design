# freeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design

5 projects for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certificate.

Links & User stories provided for each project.

## Future Goals

While I am proud of these projects, I would like to improve the Personal Portfolio page and the Technical Documentation page in the future.

## Takeaway

While I feel very comfortable working with HTML/CSS, I really need to learn more about modern styles/trends.
