          Elon Reeve Musk is an American entrepreneur who got his start with
          Zip2 and X.com (an online bank which later became Paypal). With the
          money Elon made from the sale of Paypal to Ebay, he founded a
          company known as SpaceX in 2002. He dreamt of the affordable
          colonization of Mars, and the company has gone on to revolutionize
          space travel. SpaceX created reusable rockets which drastically cut
          down on the cost of launching a rocket. They created the Falcon
          Heavy, which is double the world's most powerful rocket. Arguably
          their greatest achievement is being the first private spacecraft to
          send astronauts to the ISS. The rocket that carried the astronauts
          used advanced AI to automatically dock. In 2004, he started to
          invest in Tesla, an electric car company co-founded by Martin
          Eberhard. Musk not only invested in Tesla, he actually helped
          develop its first car, the Roadster, and not long after he became
          CEO. Once again, he helped revolutionize a market. Musk knew that
          electric cars were the future, and he knew he had to create an
          electric car the average person would be interested in, now it seems
          like every car manufacturer is scrambling to compete. Outside of
          SpaceX and Tesla, Elon has gone on to form other companies and
          ideas, like The Boring Company, Solar City, Neuralink, and OpenAI.
